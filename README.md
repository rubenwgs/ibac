# Project Title: Analysis of Non-Periodic Activation Functions in Coordinate-MLPs

## Introduction
This project investigates the generalization capabilities of non-periodic activation functions in coordinate multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), focusing on overcoming the limitations of ReLU activations in representing continuous signals with high fidelity. Based on the foundational work by Sitzmann et al. and others, we explore several activation functions, including Gaussian, Quadratic, Laplacian, and ExpSin, for their potential in video fitting tasks and dynamic reconstruction.

## Goals
1. Evaluate the fitting and generalization capabilities of selected activation functions on the video fitting task in ResFields.
2. Adapt the best-performing activation function for dynamic reconstruction tasks.

## Installation and Usage
Provide instructions here on how to set up the project environment (e.g., required libraries, Python version) and how to run the scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

## Data
Describe the dataset used in this project, including how to access it and any preprocessing steps necessary for replication.

## Results
Summarize findings, including performance metrics and any insights gained from the analysis.
